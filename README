Implementation Successes/Failures:
       Our readaline function can read lines of any length (as long as there is
       enough RAM to store them).
       We successfully restored all the files in the corruption folder in
       /comp/40.
       To our eyes, we have implemented restoration succefully to spec,
       outputting readable and sensible raw pgm's to the stdout stream. These
       pgms can be displayed using pnmrdr.
